# Supermarket Sales Exploratory Data Analysis Project 


Project Overview

Intending to expand my technical skills and project experiences, I wanted to complete a real-world style analytics project. I sourced a supermarket sales dataset on Kaggle and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on this dataset. With a strong focus on answering domain and business-driven questions to support decision-making. 

The objective of this project was to explore sales performance across products, regions, time and product categories, and to transform this exploration into meaningful business insights. I explored these questions in depth, but found myself limited by the lack of data, as a result, findings are presented as strongly supported hypotheses compared to definitive conclusions.

Business & Domain Questions

1. Which products generate the highest total revenue across the business?  
2. How does product performance vary by state?  
3. How is revenue distributed across product categories within each state?  
4. How do sales revenue and transaction volumes change over time?  
5. Is revenue growth driven more by transaction volume or by higher-value transactions?  
6. Are there seasonal patterns in product category performance?  
7. How consistent is sales performance across states?
   
Tools and Technologies

Python
-	Pandas (data cleaning and manipulation)
-	Matplotlib.pyplot (data visualisation)
  
Tableau
-	Interactive dashboard
-	KPI-style dashboard
-	Dashboard filters for exploratory analysis
  
Process

-	Loaded and inspected raw sales data and assessed data quality
-	Performed feature engineering on date fields (e.g. month, quarter, year) to enable time-based analysis
-	Aggregated sales data at product, category, state, monthly, and quarterly levels.
-	 Used exploratory data analysis to identify trends, insights, and answer business questions.
-	Exported a clean dataset for visualisation.
-	Built an interactive dashboard to visualise and communicate key findings.
